# FeedbackForge: A Modular Library for User Feedback Loops

FeedbackForge is a Python library designed to facilitate the implementation of structured feedback loops in applications. By modeling user interactions, outcomes, and states within a time-aware framework, it enables developers to track actions and evaluate their results with ease.

## Features

- **Flexible Contexts**: Define and manage the environment in which interactions occur.
- **Timed States**: Track states and their transitions with precise timing information.
- **Action-Outcome Linking**: Model actions and their outcomes for detailed feedback loops.
- **Extensible Design**: Abstract base classes for customization across different applications.
- **Time Management**: Built-in tools for absolute and relative timestamp handling.
- **Serialization Support**: Convert interactions and their components to dictionaries for easy storage and processing.
